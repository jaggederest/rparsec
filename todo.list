- parse errors with bigger index has higher precedence.
- set parse error to nil when success. check nil when appending.
- be able to mixin Parsers methods.
- use *alts instead of alts for PlusParser
- use "seq" function when it is available. use bind otherwise.
~ Come up with do notation.
- longest, shortest, longer, shorter
- many
- some
- separated, separated1
- delimited, delimited1
- atom
- is
- satisfies
- repeat
- use operator "*" for repeat_.
- look ahead
- get_index
- errors could be a tree, instead of linear
- use Forwardable.def_delegators
- are
- string, str
- char
- not
- not_char
- not_string
- isnt
- arent
- operator |
- | and >>
- operator table
- ~ for isnt
- among
- notAmong
- the first element in the input can be used in the error message as "something encountered".
- line number and column number should be in error message and exception.
- change "... encountered" to "... unexpected" for the not methods.
- expect
- change "Parser.isnt" to "Parser.not"
* unicode support
- print char rather than fixnum in error message
- support lex/parser phases. token object with raw index is needed.
- get_index should return index of the current input
- eof
- followed, '<<'
- any
- repeat_
- many_
- some_
- between. done by >> and <<
- range
- detect infinite loop for many
- detect infinite loop for some
- word
- integer
- number
- regex
- token
- optional
- | can be used to do 'plus' on values (by calling value implicitly)
- use singleton Nil instead of value(nil).
- throwp, catchp
- use repeat to represent "some".
- allow optional to take a parameter, which is the default value.
- string case insensitive.
- fragment
- line comment
- block comment
* nestable block comment
- whitespace
- lexeme
- create an Operators class where operators that may contain each other can be scanned properly. 
- lexeme should allow no whitespace before the first element.
- create a Keywords class that lex and parse keywords. (with good defaulting lexer support)
- infixl
- infixr
- infixn
- prefix
- postfix
- Functors
? step for logical step instead of physical offset
- lazy
? once we have step, change OperatorTable so that operators automatically ignore whitespace (or specified delimiter)
- peek
- allow >> to do auto-boxing for parser.
- nested parser should report "token encountered" instead of "char" encountered.
- allow (a|b|c) to be treated as sum(a,b,c), avoid nesting.
* allow (a>>b>>c) to be treated as sequence(a,b,c), avoid nesting.
? should we do "longest" for "|"? Perf or usability? No.
